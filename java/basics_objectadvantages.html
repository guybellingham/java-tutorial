            <p><b>Java objects are hardware independent</b>. You may hear talk 
              of 'write once run anywhere'. This means that Java objects, are 
              'abstracted' in a clever way from the different underlying operating 
              systems (MAC, WIN, or UNIX). Java programs are actually executed, 
              by a 'Java Virtual Machine' (JVM), a kind of universal interpreter, 
              that presents a common operating environment to your Java programs, 
              no matter what flavour of machine and operating system it is running 
              on. </p>
            <p><b>Java objects are easy to program with</b>. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Java Virtual Machine handles all memory allocation and deallocation 
                for you, so that you never have to worry about reserving memory 
                to build objects in, or freeing memory after an object is no longer 
                needed. Java also hides the way memory is handled by your particular 
                operating system.</li>
              <li>Java arrays have runtime checking, that prevents you indexing 
                them beyond their bounds and addressing invalid memory areas.</li>
              <li>The Java language specification also defines robust type checking. 
                The compiler checks that all variables are declared before they 
                are first used. Variables and arrays defined within an object 
                are guaranteed to be initialized by the JVM at runtime. Note: 
                This does NOT apply to variables defined within method blocks.</li>
              <li>Java Exception handling is a part of the language which you 
                are 'forced' to abide by. </li>
              <li>Strictly speaking Java does not have an explicit 'pointer' like 
                other languages. Which means you do not have programming control 
                over memory addresses. All memory addressing and handling is automatic, 
                which leaves you free to concentrate on the 'real' programming 
                issues. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Java object definitions are reusable</b>. The power of the object 
              approach, is that a well written object definition (termed a class), 
              is reusable and extensible. Once you have defined the properties 
              and behaviours of a class of object, you can use that object in 
              any program you write. If the object doesn't exactly fit your current 
              programs' needs, you can define another class of object, which extends 
              the functionality of the 'parent' object definition. You can also 
              'override' the behaviors of the parent object type if you desire. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Anything can be represented by some class (or type) of object</b>. 
              Objects are abstracted enough from the world of computer hardware 
              and operating systems, that you can model an everyday problem or 
              process using terms that belong in the real world. For example a 
              painting program might be developed using classes called, 'Canvas', 
              'Color' and 'Circle' ..etc </p>
