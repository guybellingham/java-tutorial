          <td align="left" valign="top" colspan="2"><p>The AWT provides you with 
              a library of Java classes that you can use to build a graphical 
              user interface. The AWT classes essentially wrap the GUI components 
              of the underlying operating system. They do this through what are 
              termed 'peers'. Each AWT graphical component (a Button or a Window), 
              has a corresponding peer class, that does the 'dirty work' of talking 
              to the native operating system GUI. You can use the AWT classes, 
              without worrying about the complexities and peculiarities of the 
              user interface of each operating system. By assembling instances 
              of the AWT classes, you can build a user interface that looks and 
              feels just like the native interface of the underlying operating 
              system.</p>
            <p>Note, that the AWT is what is termed a 'heavyweight' approach to 
              building a GUI. That is it relies upon the 'native' user interface 
              of the operating system. There are some drawbacks to this approach, 
              in that the AWT can only provide you with the lowest common denominator 
              of functionality, between all the operating systems. Also performance 
              and event handling issues in the AWT, prompted the search for a 
              better solution for a cross platform user interface.</p>
            <p>The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) were introduced in the 1.1 version 
              of the JDK, and offerred a 'lightweight' approach to building a 
              cross platform user interface in Java. A central part of the JFC 
              are the SWING classes, first delivered as extensions to the core 
              <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">java.*</font> 
              classes in the <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">javax.swing.*</font> 
              packages. SWING is now built-in to the core of the J2SE. SWING components 
              are an extension of the existing AWT classes, but they add to the 
              graphical functionality in these main ways : </p>
            <ol>
              <li>A new and better performing event handling model, based upon 
                event listeners.</li>
              <li>Support for pluggable and custom look and feel, and a 'lightweight' 
                graphical presentation.</li>
              <li> Support for drag and drop and some of the more advanced user 
                interface features, such as custom borders and icons.</li>
              <li>New more powerful graphical controls such as JTree and JTable 
                based upon the Model-View-Controller architecture, that seperates 
                the presentation logic from the data model of a graphical control.</li>
            </ol>
			Before we look at the Swing classes, we need to look at the AWT classes upon which they are built.
