            <p><b>Everything in Java is an object</b>, a Java program is a type 
              of object, and in essence contains a collection of other <a
        href="javascript:popup('keywords.html#object')">objects</a>, which send 
              and receive messages telling one another what needs to be done. 
              The complexity of a conventional 'program' is broken up into interactions 
              between self contained packets of Java code and data (objects). 
            </p>
            <p><b>An object exists at runtime in computer memory</b>, and respresents 
              a particular <i>instance</i> of an object definition. Objects have 
              code (also termed <i>behaviors</i>) and data (also known as <i>properties)</i>. 
              Objects generally serve a single functional purpose. Java refers 
              to objects, using their address in memory. Objects exist only when 
              a Java program is running. Objects are loaded at runtime, from definition 
              files that have a <span class="code">.class</span> extension. These 
              'class files' contain all the information needed to construct an 
              object, initialize its data and define the things that it can then 
              do at runtime. </p>
            <p><b>Objects, have a number of essential characteristics</b>, the 
              most important of which are : </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>encapsulation</b> - the ability to hide their data and logic 
                away, and to be self contained and portable.</li>
              <li><b>inheritance</b> - the ability to base one object type upon 
                an existing object type, and extend its functionality in some 
                desired way. </li>
              <li><b>polymorphism</b> - this is a tricky one to explain, and we'll 
                cover it in more detail on a later page. Essentially it means 
                that you can handle an object as if it were its more generic parent 
                or grandparent object. This is very useful when you want your 
                code to be able to work with a variety of objects that all inherit 
                from a generic parent object type. </li>
            </ul>

      <p>This is a common way of depicting an object, with its variables (or 'properties') 
        protected inside a 'shell' that consists of the public methods (the 'behaviors').</p>
                  
      <p>Other objects can act on the variables of this object, but only in a 
        controlled way, through the available methods. The ideal is to advertise 
        <b>what</b> an object can do but hide <b>how</b> it does it. As we'll 
        see in a later page, Java has keywords that let you control access to 
        methods and variables inside an object. </p>

      <p><b>Objects can contain other objects.</b> So that in addition to being 
        able to derive new object types from existing ones, you can also build 
        new types of objects, by assembling other existing objects, much like 
        building with Lego bricks.</p>
