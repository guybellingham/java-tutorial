            <p><b>A Java class defines a type of object, which an outside 'client' 
              can manipulate to do something useful at runtime.</b> <br>
              When designing classes, you have to decide whether a class should 
              be generally available to classes in other package folders. You 
              have to decide, if you want runtime objects to be constructed from 
              the class, or whether it should serve as a base for other classes 
              to extend. Lastly you must decide whether you want to permit other 
              classes to extend and possibly overrride behaviors defined in your 
              class. </p>
            <p><b>The <span class="stdCode">public</span> keyword </b>when applied 
              to the class statement means the class is designed for general availability. 
              <br>
              When you define a class with the public access modifier, you permit 
              ‘outside’ classes in other packages to create new instances of the 
              class and refer to public members (variables and methods) within 
              the class. Most of the built in java classes are defined as public, 
              and they allow you to import them, and instantiate and refer to 
              their methods and variables from within your own classes and packages.<br>
              Without the public keyword, a class is only visible to other classes 
              defined in the same package.</p>
            <p><b>The <span class="stdCode">abstract</span> class keyword</b> 
              means this class is not designed to be instantiated.<br>
              Sometimes your software solution, may require a class of object 
              for which you have no ‘real world’ use. Such classes are useful 
              to provide incomplete or generic behaviors, that are designed to 
              be extended by other 'concrete' classes. <br>
              Abstract classes allow you to 'break out' common processing into 
              a single generic super class. The common processing may be incomplete, 
              but it can be reused by sub classes that extend the abstract super 
              class. <br>
              The abstract keyword is used to make it clear that a class is not 
              to be directly instantiated and used 'as is'. The Java compiler 
              will prevent classes from constructing new objects of a class marked 
              as abstract. <br>
              <b>Note</b>: Other classes can still directly reference an abstract 
              class, for use as an object variable. For example, a class like 
              <span class="stdCode">Shape</span> should probably be abstract, 
              since its sole purpose is to serve as a base upon which to build 
              real world classes like <span class="stdCode">Rectangle, Circle</span> 
              and <span class="stdCode">Polygon</span> ..etc </p>
            <pre class="stdCode"><font color="#999999">//class designed for all Shapes to share</font><br>public <font color="#FF0000">abstract</font> class Shape {
<font color="#666666">  <font color="#999999">//incomplete or generic implementation here</font>  </font>
} </pre>
            <p>My classes can still make use of the <span class="stdCode">Shape</span> 
              class, when defining an object variable if they want to take advantage 
              of polymorphism, but the compiler will not allow a new Shape object 
              to be constructed. </p>
            <p><span class="stdCode"><font color="#999999">//Treat a Circle object 
              like a Shape</font><br>
              <font color="#FF0000">Shape s1</font> = new Circle(5,5,50);<br>
              <font color="#999999">//Treat a Rectangle like a Shape</font><br>
              <font color="#FF0000">s1</font> = new Rectangle(5,5,50,60); <br>
              </span> </p>
            <p><b>The <span class="stdCode">final</span> keyword on a class statement</b>, 
              means this class is at the end of a branch of the inheritance tree, 
              and cannot be extended by other classes. <br>
              If you mark an entire class as final you prohibit any other class 
              from extending that class. This is useful if you want a secure design 
              (one that cannot be overridden by a sub class), and as we'll see 
              on a following page, also optimizes your code. <br>
              <b>Beware</b><b>!</b> All the member variables and methods of a 
              class marked as final automatically become final as well, because 
              they cannot be overridden by any subclasses. </p>
            <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Invalid combinations.</font></b> Certain 
              combinations of class keywords do not make sense and are invalid. 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>An abstract class cannot also be final.</b> This is because 
                a final class cannot be extended by a sub class. A final class 
                must be fully defined, since no sub classes can make up for any 
                ‘missing’ or abstract parts of the class definition.</li>
