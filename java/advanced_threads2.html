              a thread spends some time executing and some time in any of several 
              non-executing states. The scheduling of threads is an operating 
              system dependent function, Java does not guarantee a particular 
              behavior. Java, does provide for some control of thread execution 
              : the setting of thread priorities, and synchronization and communication 
              between threads.</p>
            <p>A thread is 'alive' between the time it is started and when it 
              stops. <br>
              Once started, a thread becomes 'ready' to run.<br>
              The operating system scheduler, decides which thread gets control 
              of the CPU.<br>
              A thread automatically stops once its' run( ) method exits.<br>
              A thread can be forced to stop, by calling the stop( ) method on 
              the thread object.</p>

    <td><p>Many methods that perform some sort of input or output, have to wait 
        for something to happen (locating of a file or opening of a network connection) 
        in the outside world before they can proceed. A thread that has to wait 
        on the slow moving outside world, must reliquish control of the CPU, so 
        that useful work can continue and the computer remains responsive.<br>
        All this is handled by the runtime environment, and threads waiting for 
        resources are said to be 'blocked'.</p>
      <p>'Monitor states' represents threads that voluntarily issue a <span class="stdCode">wait(

        the <span class="stdCode">java.lang.Object</span> class and cannot be 
        overidden by your classes. Note: The methods you can use to influence 
        a threads' execution are examined on the next page.</p>

            a lower priority one and takes over the CPU.<br>
            This scheme works well for cooperating threads, that are working on 
            related tasks. However a high priority thread can monopolize the CPU.</font></td>
