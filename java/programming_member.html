            <p><b>Java permits the following keywords to precede statements that 
              define variables and methods in a class. <br>
              </b>These are in addition to the keywords <span class="stdCode">public 
              protected</span> and <span class="stdCode">private</span>, that 
              allow you to <a href="basics_encapsulation.html">encapsulate</a> 
              data and logic in your classes. When declaring member methods in 
              your class, you have to decide whether you want to define just the 
              <a href="basics_methods.html">signature</a> of the method, or provide 
              an implementation for the method as well. When defining member variables 
              and methods, you have the option to finalize the data or logic so 
              that no subclass can override the data value or method implementation. 
              Methods and variable values can be given a class wide scope or can 
              be specific to particular instances of a class (belong to an object).</p>
            <p><b>An <span class="stdCode">abstract</span> method </b>can be defined 
              only within an <span class="stdCode">abstract</span> class. <br>
              An abstract method is one without a body of code, and which is meant 
              to be overridden by subclasses. If a class contains an abstract 
              method, it must also be declared abstract, because it is 'missing' 
              implementation details, and should not be directly instantiated. 
              (The term <i>instantiation</i>, refers to the process of constructing 
              a new object from a class at runtime).</p>
            <p><b>A <span class="stdCode">final</span> variable</b> has a constant 
              value that cannot be overridden by any subclasses. When variables 
              are declared final, the Java compiler knows that their values will 
              not change. So for example instead of a reference to the member 
              variable such as <span class="stdCode">java.lang.Math.PI</span> 
              the compiler might 'optimize' your code and substitute the constant 
              value (3.14159) instead. You must give a final variable an initial 
              value when you declare it. <br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>Gotcha!</b></font> When you make an object 
              variable <span class="stdCode">final</span>, it means that variable 
              always refers to the same object in memory, the one created by its 
              initializer. However, a method can still reference that object and 
              its public members and even change its properties.</p>
            <p><b>A <span class="stdCode">final</span> method</b> has guaranteed 
              processing that cannot be overridden by any subclasses. A final 
              method, can give you the security, that its processing won’t be 
              overridden by any subclasses. For example the <span class="stdCode">java.lang.String</span> 
              class defines final methods, so that other classes can't subvert 
              or pretend to be Java String objects.<br>
              When a method that is declared as final is referenced, the compiler 
              is free to replace the complicated and slow method lookup process, 
              with the ‘inline’ code of that method. </p>
            <p><b>A <span class="stdCode">static</span> variable</b> is associated 
              with the enclosing class, and not with any particular object constructed 
              from the class. This means that the variable exists just once in 
              memory when the class is loaded by the Java runtime. The variable 
              can be referenced using the class name and is 'shared' by all objects. 
              You have to be aware of threading and 'side effects' issues when 
              using static variables.</p>
            <p><b>A <span class="stdCode">static</span> method</b> is not associated 
              with a particular instance of a class. The method implementation 
              is loaded once into memory, when the class is first referenced. 
              This has a couple of important consequences: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>You cannot use the keyword this (to refer to the current object)</li>
              <li>You cannot refer to a non-static variable or method by name 
                from within the static method. </li>
            </ol>
            <pre class="code"><span class="stdCode"><font color="#999999">//class designed for all Shapes to share</font><br>public <font color="#FF0000">abstract</font> class Shape {
<font color="#666666">  <font color="#999999">//incomplete or generic implementation here</font>  </font>
} </span>
</pre>
            <p><b>The <span class="stdCode">synchronized</span> keyword</b> can 
              precede a method statement or code block, it causes <i>threads</i> 
              of execution to queue up when entering blocks of code, so that the 
              whole section of code is finished by one thread, before another 
              thread can begin processing it.<br>
              Java supports <i>multi-threading</i>, which is a way of doing several 
              things at once with the same processor or multiple CPUs. However 
              certain ‘<i>critical sections</i>’ of code, are vulnerable to errors 
              if more than one thread, is processing that code at the same time.<br>
              We will explore the concepts of Java threads and how to control 
              them in a following page.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Invalid combinations.</font></b> Certain 
              combinations of member keywords do not make sense and are not allowed 
              by the Java compiler. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>An abstract method cannot also be final.</b> A final method 
                must be fully defined, since no subclasses can override the method 
                and make up for any ‘missing’ or abstract parts of the method 
                implementation.</li>
              <li> Less obviously <b>a static method cannot also be abstract</b>, 
                since there is no object instance associated with a static method, 
                and therefore no <span class="code">this</span> or <span class="code">super</span> 
                references can be made to the current or parent object, there 
                is no way to override the ‘missing’ body of a static method. A 
                static method is not associated with any object at runtime, and 
                therefore it cannot be overridden by an <i>instance</i> of a subclass. 
              </li>
              <li>An <b>abstract method cannot also be marked as native</b>. A 
                native method is one written in a platform dependent language 
                (not Java).</li>
