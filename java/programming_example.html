            <p><a name="top"></a><b>STEP#1.</b> In this first program, we are 
              going to write an application that has no graphical user interface. 
              GUI programming in java is a complicated subject involving the large 
              and complex <a href="awt_intro.html">AWT</a> and <a href="swing.html">SWING</a> 
              class libraries. This command line application will build upon the 
              subjects covered in the programming section, and assumes you have 
              already read the <a href="basics_example.html">instructions on downloading 
              the J2SE development kit</a> and run the ExampleProgram to verify 
              the install.</p>
            <p><a name="main"></a> As noted in the downloading instructions, the 
              Java runtime, looks for a method with the signature : <font color="#FF0000"><span class="stdCode">public 
              static void main(String[] arg)</span></font> to start executing 
              an application. <br>
              Now you need to understand that this a <a href="javascript:popup('keywords.html#static')" class="stdCode">static</a> 
              method, which means it is not associated with the world of objects, 
              it is 'outside' the realm of individual objects and constructors 
              and inheritance. Instead this method is associated with the class 
              as a whole, and is built when the class file is first loaded into 
              memory. The thing about static methods, is that you are limited 
              to referencing other static methods and variables, you cannot reference 
              an individual object, unless someone else passes you a reference 
              to one.<br>
              To program in the object world, we need to do a sort of 'bootstrap' 
              maneuver (pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps) to construct 
              an object based upon the applications class (an instance of ourself) 
              as shown below.</p>

            <p>Notice that the class name is <b>Example1</b>.<br>
              I have included a <span class="stdCode"><b>package</b></span> statement 
              (as the first statement), after which I used the <span class="stdCode"><b>import</b></span> 
              statements to make it easy to reference classes in other java packages. 
              <br>
              This source code includes some javadoc comments (between<span class="stdCode"> 
              /**</span> and <span class="stdCode">*/</span>). <br>
              The class contains a static String variable called <b>s0</b>, and 
              an instance <span class="stdCode">String</span> variable called 
              <b>s1</b>. It also contains an instance variable of the <span class="stdCode">java.io.BufferedReader</span> 
              class called <b>buf</b>, which is assigned to a new BufferedReader 
              object in the class constructor method.<br>
              The class contains a single <b>constructor method</b> (with no return 
              type), that invokes its parent class constructor with the super( 
              ); statement. This enables any parent classes to do their own thing, 
              during object construction and is not strictly necessary, since 
              the java compiler inserts this statement if you forget it. The constructor 
              method goes on to build a <span class="stdCode">java.io.InputStreamReader 
              </span>object called isr. Note that this statement and the following 
              one can both throw a <span class="stdCode">java.io.IOException</span>, 
              but that this method simply passes the buck, by declaring that it 
              can also throw this type of exception up the calling chain.<br>
              Lastly a <span class="stdCode">main( )</span> method is the entry 
              point into our application. The first thing it does is create an 
              object based upon our class. Because this involves calling the constructor 
              method which can <span class="stdCode">throw</span> an <span class="stdCode">IOException</span>, 
              our main method must either catch such exceptions or re-throw them, 
              in this case it simply throws any exception generated back to the 
              java runtime.</p>

			<p><b>STEP#5</b>. Now we're going to add a method that makes use of 
              the buffered character reader called <span class="code">buf</span>. 
              Copy and paste this method into your Example1.java class definition. 
            <pre  class="code"><span class="stdCode"><font color="#999999">/** 
* get user input as a String. 
*/ </font>
public String getUserInput() throws IOException { 
   return buf.readLine(); 
}</span>
</pre> 
<p>The <span class="code">buf</span> object was built in our constructor 
              method, by 'wrapping' a local InputStreamReader object called <span class="code">isr</span>. 
              This is a common technique for adding layers around an object. You'll 
              see that when we constructed the InputStreamReader object, we wrapped 
              yet another object called <span class="code">System.in</span>.</p>
            <p>Next copy and paste the statements in red into the main( ) method 
              of your Example1.java class definition. Notice that to reference 
              instance variables or methods of our class, we must use the <span class="code">app</span> 
              object, as in <span class="stdCode">app.getUserInput(); </span>
            <pre class="stdCode">public static void main(String[] args)              
  throws IOException { 
  <font color="#999999">//bootstrap the app object </font>
  Example1 app = new Example1(); 
  <font color="#FF0000">//Prompt the user 
  System.out.print("Please enter a phrase: "); 
  //Get the user input 
  StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(app.getUserInput()); 
  //Echo the input backwards <br>  System.out.println("Backwards that is " + sb.reverse());</font> 
}</pre>
            <p><b>Note:</b> <span class="stdCode">System.in</span> is an object 
              that the java runtime environment provides for you. It corresponds 
              to the system console (or command line) input stream. We'll talk 
              more about Streams when we look at the Java IO (input and output) 
              classes. There is also a <span class="stdCode">System.out</span> 
              object available to you, and it provides a number of useful <span class="stdCode"><b>print( 
              )</b></span> and <span class="stdCode"><b>println( )</b></span> 
              methods for printing text to the command line. </p>
