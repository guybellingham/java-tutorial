            <p><b>Java helps you to encapsulate your objects.</b> This means you 
              can hide the inner workings (the implementation) and only expose 
              the public interface you want other objects to see. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>This creates a clear understanding of how your object is to 
                be used (through the public interface).</li>
              <li>It prevents other objects from delving into the workings of 
                your object and messing things up (avoiding nasty side effects).</li>
              <li>It allows you to change the way your object works while maintaining 
                the same interface (avoiding a ripple effect of changes). </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Java uses the keywords</b> <b><a href="javascript:popup('keywords.html#public')">public</a></b>, 
              <b><a href="javascript:popup('keywords.html#protected')">protected</a></b> 
              <b>and</b> <b><a href="javascript:popup('keywords.html#private')">private</a></b> 
              to declare different levels of access to the variables and methods 
              inside a class of object. We'll look at member methods and variables 
              on the next pages. </p>
            <p><b>You can also use the </b><a href="javascript:popup('keywords.html#public')"><b>public</b></a> 
              <b>keyword on your object definition</b>, to signify that it is 
              generally accessible to other types of objects, in other packages 
              (in other libraries). For example most of the built in Java classes 
              are defined as public, and allow you to import them, and create 
              objects from them and refer to their methods and variables from 
              within your own classes and packages. </p>
            <p><b>These keywords</b>, control access to variables and methods 
              in the following general way (going from least to most restricted) 
              : </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>public</b> - a public variable or method is accessible from 
                any class that can access the class that contains that member 
                variable or method. </li>
              <li><b>protected</b> - a protected member variable or method can 
                be accessed from any class within the same package and by classes 
                defined in other packages that inherit from the members class. 
              </li>
              <li><b>private</b> - You can only reference a private member from 
                within the class in which it is defined. </li>
            </ul>

      <p>This diagram shows the effect that putting classes in different packages 
        has upon access rights.</p>
      <p>Notice that the Cat class is <em>not</em> defined as <b>public</b>. This 
        means that classes in other packages cannot even 'see' the Cat class.</p>
      <p>The Dog class is <b>public</b>, and classes in other packages do have 
        access to its public members (all classes can reference rovers name). 
        However, the yellow arrow means that only classes in other packages that 
        inherit from Dog, can access protected members, like rovers bark.</p>
      <p>Members with no access modifier, and those that are declared private 
        are not accessible to classes in other packages. </p>

      <p>Classes within the same package, have much less restrictions on access
