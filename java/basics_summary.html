            <ul>
              <li>So far, we've seen how to define a type of object, using the 
                <i>class</i> statement. It is important to distinguish a class 
                definition from an actual object. The class acts like a sort of 
                cookie cutter, whereas an object is like an individual cookie 
                made with the cookie cutter.</li>
              <li>You know that a class definition usually <i>extends</i> (is 
                based upon) an existing class of object. We've talked about how 
                objects <i>inherit</i> the <i>methods</i> (the logic) and <i>variables</i> 
                (the data) of all the <i>super</i> classes that they extend. In 
                fact classes have an inheritance hierarchy (a family tree), and 
                the java.lang.Object class (at the root of the tree) is the grand 
                daddy of all Java classes. </li>
              <li>Java allows you to package your classes using a folder structure 
                of your own choosing. This helps you to group related classes 
                and ensure that class names are unique and do not clash with existing 
                classes. To uniquely identify a class to the compiler, you may 
                type its fully qualified class name (which is the package folders 
                and subfolders, followed by the class name, all seperated by the 
                full stop character).You may also use the <i>import</i> statement 
                to identify to the compiler, which package folders it should search 
                to find the classes referenced from within your class definition.</li>
              <li> We've also discussed the <i>public</i>, <i>protected</i> and 
                <i>private</i> keywords, that allow you to <i>encapsulate</i> 
                or hide data and logic inside your objects. </li>
              <li>Java ClassLoaders are responsible for finding and loading the 
                compiled <i>.class</i> files and building objects by invoking 
                the special <i>constructor</i> method which returns the address 
                of the newly constructed object in memory. </li>
              <li>You've seen that Java objects are <i>polymorphic</i>; that is, 
                they can be treated as if they were a more generic but related 
                class and can even be handled by any programming <i>interface</i> 
                they implement.</li>
              <li>To give you more flexibility in designing a class (or type) 
                of object, Java allows you to define an <i>interface. </i>An interface 
                is like a class, except that you do not flesh out the member methods 
                (they are abstract), and any member variables are automatically 
                defined as constant (or final) values. An interface is a sort 
                of contract or protocol of behavior, which can be implemented 
                by classes. Classes that <i>implement</i> an interface are agreeing 
                to override the empty methods in the interface with their own 
                methods. </li>
              <li>You should now know how to construct and refer to a <i>new</i> 
                object in memory at runtime, using an object variable. You assign 
                the new instance of a class to an object variable or 'handle'. 
                It is through the object variable, that you indirectly reference 
                the methods and variables of the object, using a 'dot notation'. 
                <b>Note:</b> When assigning objects with the = operator, and comparing 
                objects with the == operator you are actually dealing with object 
                addresses and not the objects themselves.</li>
              <li>Within the class statement you define member methods (the logic) 
                and member variables (the data). Variables defined outside of 
                any code blocks in a class, are called <i>instance variables</i> 
                and are accessible from anywhere within the class. Variables defined 
                within a method code block (known as <i>local variables</i>) are 
                accessible only within the curly braces of that code block. </li>
              <li>A method statement, defines a single return type (or the keyword 
                void), the method name and optionally any parameters expected 
                by the method in parentheses. The combination of the method name 
                and the parameters it accepts is the methods <i>signature</i>, 
                which must be unique within a class. Methods may be <i>overloaded</i>, 
                having the same name, with different combinations of parameters. 
                Methods in a subclass may <i>override</i> methods inherited from 
                a super class if they have the same signature and return type.</li>
