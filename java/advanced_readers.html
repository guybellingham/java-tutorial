              with bytes of data is cumbersome, java programs usually need to 
              read or write highly structured data. Another problem with bytes 
              is that the 8-bit encoding schemes used, do not accommodate international 
              character sets. </p>
            <p>Java 1.1 introduced two new character based (16-bit) Input and 
              Output streams, called <span class="stdCode">Reader</span> and <span class="stdCode">Writer</span>, 
              which are faster at retrieving blocks of data, and make it easier 
              to develop programs in foreign languages. </p>

  <tr> 
    <td><p><span class="stdCode"><strong>Reader</strong></span><strong> and <span class="stdCode">Writer</span></strong> 
        are abstract classes, that are extended by classes you can use to read 
        or write Strings and character arrays to files, buffers and arrays in 
        memory, byte streams, and pipes, for example:</p>
      <p class="stdCode">BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;foobar.txt&quot;)); 
        <br>
        String s = br.readLine(); </p>
      <p>The primary advantage of character streams is that they make it easy 
        to write programs that are not dependent upon a specific character encoding, 
        and are therefore easy to internationalize. Java stores strings in Unicode, 
        an international standard character encoding that is capable of representing 
        most of the world's written languages. Typical user-readable text files, 
        however, use encodings that are not necessarily related to Unicode, or 
        even to ASCII, and there are many such encodings. Character streams hide 
        the complexity of dealing with these encodings by providing two classes 
        that serve as bridges between byte streams and character streams. </p>
      <p>The <span class="stdCode">InputStreamReader</span> class implements a 
        character-input stream that reads bytes from a byte-input stream and converts 
        them to characters according to a specified encoding. Similarly, the <span class="stdCode">OutputStreamWriter</span> 
        class implements a character-output stream that converts characters into 
        bytes according a specified encoding and writes them to a byte-output 
        stream. </p>
      <p>A second advantage of character streams is that they are potentially 
        much more efficient than byte streams. The implementations of many of 
        Java's original byte streams are oriented around byte-at-a-time read and 
        write operations. The character-stream classes, in contrast, are oriented 
        around buffer-at-a-time read and write operations. This difference, in 
        combination with a more efficient locking scheme, allows the character 
        stream classes to make up for the added overhead of encoding conversion 
        in many cases. </p></td>
