              In object-oriented languages such as Java, data and code are tightly 
              bound together so that one does not exist without the other. To 
              support permanent information in an object-oriented manner, you 
              need a scheme to preserve the qualities of an object-oriented language 
              when the object instances are temporarily written to a file and 
              later restored. </p>
            <p>'Persistence' in an object-oriented programming language deals 
              with the capability of objects to exist beyond the lifetime of the 
              program that created them. <br>
              No longer is object persistence a task each programmer must independently 
              implement for himself or herself. JDK 1.1 adds the following persistence-related

    <td><p>The JDK support for serialization allows versioning of serialized objects, 
        and interoperation with previous versions of a stored object, as long 
        as you follow some simple rules. When you store an object in an <span class="stdCode">ObjectOutputStream</span>, 
        the serialVersionUID of the class is written to the stream to ensure that 
        the correct class is found when the object is restored. The serialVersionUID 
        is a hash computed over various attributes of the class, including the 
        class name, implemented interface names, field names, and method names. 
        When the object is restored, the class is loaded by name and then verified 
        to be identical by comparing the serialVersionUID of the class from the 
        stream with the serialVersionUID computed for the class just loaded. If 
        you add fields, interfaces, or methods to a class definition, the serialVersionUID 
        changes and the new class is assumed to be incompatible with the old. 
        To provide for interoperation between different versions of the same class, 
        you must explicitly declare the serialVersionUID of the class you are 
        compatible with and follow some simple rules in creating the new version:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Do not delete a field or change it to be transient or static </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Do not change a field's built-in type (for example, do not change 
            ashort to an int)</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Do not change a class from Serializable to Externalizable or vice 
            versa </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can add fields, add methods, change access modifiers, and implement 
        new interfaces. However, in all cases, you must deal with the consequences 
        of class change, such as missing fields when restoring an object saved 
        by an earlier version of the class. </p>
      <p><strong>JDK 1.1 uses a manually controlled object persistence scheme</strong>. 
        The storage and retrieval of persistent Java objects is completely under 
        your control. To make an object persistent, you create an <span class="stdCode">ObjectOutputStream</span> 
        and serialize the object by calling the <span class="stdCode">writeObject()</span> 
        method on it. You specify where the output of the ObjectOutputStream goes, 
        and hence where the object is serialized. When you wrap the ObjectOutputStream 
        around a FileOutputStream, and you write the state of the object to a 
        file as shown in the following code: </p>
      <p class="stdCode">FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(filename);<br>
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fout);<br>
        out.writeObject(obj);</p>
      <p>Wrap the ObjectOutputStream around an OutputStream retrieved from a socket 
        (using getOutputStream()), and you transfer the state of the object across 
        the Internet to another machine as shown here: </p>
      <p class="stdCode">Socket s = new Socket(remotehost, remoteport);<br>
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());<br>
        out.writeObject(obj);</p>
      <p>Conversely, to restore an object, you create an <span class="stdCode">ObjectInputStream</span> 
        and call the <span class="stdCode">readObject()</span> method. You wrap 
        ObjectInputStream around various types of input streams in a way similar 
        to what you did with the ObjectOutputStream and the various types of output 
        streams. The next object in the stream is reconstituted and returned from 
        the readObject() call. </p>
      <p>Because the returned type of readObject() is <span class="stdCode">java.lang.Object</span>, 
        you usually want to cast the returned object to another type. Java's type-safe 
        casting ensures that you do not cast the object to an incorrect type. 
        You can also use <a
        href="../2.0_Java_programming/comparisons4.htm">instanceof</a> or methods 
        in the object reflection package to determine the type of received objects. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>The <span class="stdCode">Serializable</span> interface</strong> 
        defines no methods but is an indication that the class is compatible with 
        serialization and may have private<span class="stdCode"> readObject()</span> 
        and <span class="stdCode">writeObject()</span> methods to control serialization. 
        For many classes, you simply add <span class="stdCode">implements Serializable</span> 
        to the class definition to use the default Java runtime serialization 
        format to serialize your objects. All subtypes of a serializable class 
        are themselves serializable. </p>
      <p>Only the data in the objects and the declarations of the classes are 
        encoded in the byte stream. The Java virtual machine bytecodes that implement 
        the methods of the classes are not stored when an object is serialized. 
        When an object is retrieved from the stream, the class declaration is 
        read and the normal class-loading mechanisms (for example, searching through 
        the CLASSPATH) are used to load the code. If a matching class is not found, 
        <span class="stdCode">readObject()</span> throws <span class="stdCode">ClassNotFoundException</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>The JDK support for persistence does not deal with the issues of code 
        distribution (which must be addressed if you are going to build Java agents 
        that can migrate from machine to machine). When you store an object or 
        send it across the Internet, the object must include a copy of all the 
        objects it references, all the objects those objects reference, and so 
        on. The object has to include all these other objects because all these 
        objects are part of the total state of the one object you explicitly serialized. 
        <br>
        <strong>Note</strong>: The <span class="stdCode">writeObject()</span> 
        method does not explicitly synchronize on the object being serialized. 
        If you have multiple threads using the same object, and one thread can 
        possibly be serializing an object while another thread is manipulating 
        fields of the same object, you must take steps to be thread safe: You 
        can either add explicit synchronization code or make a 'clone' of the 
        object before serialization. </p>
      <p>Generally, objects that are tied to system resources (such as process 
        identifiers, file descriptors, network sockets, and so on) are not candidates 
        for serialization. Another clue to potential serialization problems is 
        <span class="stdCode">native</span> methods. Such methods often interact 
        with external software whose state is not automatically captured by serialization. 
        <br>
        See the <a href="../keywords.htm#transient" class="stdCode">transient</a> 
        keyword for how to exclude properties and object references from the serialization 
        process.</p>
      <p><a name="externalizable"></a><strong><span class="stdCode">The Externalizable 
        interface</span></strong> extends Serializable, and is useful in situations 
        where the class requires complete control over the encoding process. Only 
        the class identification of the object being serialized is automatically 
        written to the output stream. By implementing <span class="stdCode">Externalizable</span>, 
        your class can control whether or not the state of superclasses is stored 
        in the stream and exactly which fields are stored. For an Externalizable 
        class, you must implement the following public methods: </p>

        <tr class="stdTableColumnHeader">

        <tr> 
          <td class="stdCode">void&nbsp;readExternal(ObjectInput) </td>
          <td>The object implements the readExternal() method to restore its contents 
            by calling the methods of DataInput for primitive types and readObject() 
            for objects, strings, and arrays. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="stdCode">void&nbsp;writeExternal(ObjectOutput)</td>
          <td>The object implements the writeExternal() method to save its contents 
            by calling the methods of DataOutput for its primitive values or calling

            arrays.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The<span class="stdCode"> writeExternal()</span> method obviously must 
        encode the data of the object in a form and sequence supported by <span class="stdCode">readExternal()</span>. 
        Unlike <span class="stdCode">Serializable</span>, the <span class="stdCode">Externalizable</span> 
        interface does not handle code versioning automatically; you must provide 
        your own versioning approach. </p></td>
